# MLE_using_R
A technical reference for a MLE method using R.

In this repository, an R script together with an example data set is provided for demostration.

Please pay attention that this R script is designated for the same set of variable names in the dataset. You may want to edit the script for your own project.

Feel free to discuss with me for detailed information.
